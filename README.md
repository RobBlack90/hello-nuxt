# hello-nuxt

A super quick app built using vue-bootstrap (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for a quick ~5min nuxt.js presentation I gave.

Talk was meant to cover the basics of nuxt- highlighting the general concepts of SSR, routing (`/pages` directory), global structure (`/layouts` directory), `<nuxt-link>`, `<no-ssr>`, and `asyncData()`.

All images/logos were acquired via google images.  

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
